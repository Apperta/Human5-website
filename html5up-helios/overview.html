								<h3>Description</h3>
								The Human Five intends to be a universal health and wellbeing model enabling people to achieve an ideal state of mental, physical and thus an overall sense of fitness. It moves forward with the motto, ‘Maximise Your Health, Maximise You.’ It focusses on five areas around which our live revolves around. These are: ‘Your Mind’, ‘Your Body’, ‘Your Movement’, ‘Your Nutrition’, and ‘Your world’. Each of these five areas is linked to all of the other areas. A brief description of each of these follows:<br>
								<b><u>Your Mind</u></b> - Making the most of your mind every day, and trying to deal with the difficulties your mind encounters. Also your feelings, emotions, beliefs, values, and your knowledge and education.<br> 
								<b><u>Your Body</u></b> - This includes your body parts (anatomy) and how they work (physiology). This is the area that focuses on the health and illness/disease of your body. <br> 
								<b><u>Your Movement</u></b> - Your body is designed to move to interact with your world (functional ability). You also can gain great benefit from the simple action of physical activity.<br>  
								<b><u>Your Nutrition</u></b> - What you eat and drink can be of great benefit to you, but it can also cause of a lot of problems.  <br> 
								<b><u>Your World</u></b> -  A huge and broad range of topics covering everything to do with you and your world, including for example your environment, transport and social relationships. <br><br>
								<h3>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS)
</h3>
								With the intent to improve the mental well being, the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale was designed and developed to monitor the mental well being of the general population, and evaluate projects and programs. Encompassing both the feeling and functioning aspects of mental well being, it is a scale consisting of 14 positively-worded items each with 5 possible response categories which are evaluated to give a score ranging from 14-70.<br><br>

								<h3>Yerkes Dodson Stress Performance Curve
</h3>
								The Yerkes-Dodson Stress Performance Curve follows the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which relates the levels of arousal (stress) and performance developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson. According to the law, the performance increases with stress but only upto a certain level, beyond which the performance begins to detriment as stress further increases. This is often related with a bell-shaped curve where there is a plateau phase of maximal (optimal) performance for a given level of stress.

									 <p align="left">
										 The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded national health care system for England and one of the four National Health Services of the United Kingdom. It is the largest and the oldest single-payer healthcare systems in the world. Primarily funded through the general taxation system and overseen by the Department of Health, the system provides healthcare to every legal resident in England, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases are free for everyone, including visitors <b>(Department of Health, 2016).

											<h2 class="section-heading">What is needed by the Client?</h2><br>
											<p align="left">The National Health Service is in a state of huge change. With this change, the aim is to move towards a service that better meets every person’s individual health and wellbeing needs with NHS also inclining towards technology rather than paper. To assist this process a simple concept called “The Human Five” has been developed.
											<p align="left">One of the essential needs is for all people working in the National Health Service is to improve their own health and wellbeing, and thus their daily performance. With this aim in mind, NHS wants us to  develop a mobile application that captures it all.
											<p align="left">We are required to develop a cross-platform (Android & iOS) application. The users would be able to rate themselves on The Human Five ratings, Stress Levels, the WEMWBS and set short-term goals for them to fulfill.
											<p align="left">There are a few other scales and scoring systems out there, which to some extent are similar to the one we are creating. However, our application incorporates multiple of such measuring factors. More about other existing scales and scoring systems is soon to be mentioned in the ‘Research’ part of the website.
